# Python Data Structures (pyds)

#### Description

This is a python data structures library I am implementing in conjuction with practicing, as well as learning new data strucutures. The goal of this project is to provide out of box data structures that are prevalent in computing.


#### Motivation

The motivation to provide an out of box python data strucutures library stemmed from two places:
1. Sudden interest in algorithmic solutions to problems. Sharpening my algorithmic and data structures knowledge both theoretically and practically via implementation

2. Software engineering interviews. I'm sure we can all relate to this lmao!

#### Usage

This package can be installed locally on a users machine using the make commands that will soon be provided.

Eventually this will be available on pip. I will update the usage section accordingly as the project progresses
